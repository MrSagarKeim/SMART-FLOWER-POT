# SMART-FLOWER-POT

An conversational AI flowerpot comprising of both Alexa and Google Assistant embedded  in RPi featured with mosquito repellent and moisture level sensor using LED Display.

We designed a smart flower pot, mosquito repellent case using Fusion 360, and embedded speakers in the flower pot to enhance Google Assistant and Alexa's features. 

We took input from the soil moisture sensor, pushed buttons, real-time clock and relayed the data to Processing via Arduino. We further used them as inputs for operating the LCD Display.
